# 📊 Percentify  

**Percentify** — because fractions are overrated 😎  
A ridiculously tiny Python library for turning *"part of a whole"* into neat percentages without the brain math.  

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Calculate the percentage of any two numbers  
- ✅ Safe divide (returns `0.0` if the denominator is zero — no more crashes 🎉)  
- ✅ Control the number of decimal places  
- ✅ Zero dependencies, ultra-lightweight  

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install percentify

## 🤩 Idea
 Simply find the percentage of a number in another number.
 15 of 30 is 50%
 so percent(15, 30) == 50%
